Source Material for the CABW-SFS 2020 Workshop: **2020 CABW-SFS Workshop: Visualizing and Mapping Bioassessment Data in R**

### About R & the Workshop
R is a language for statistical computing as well as a general-purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences. This workshop will provide attendees with a chance to kickstart the ability to use and continue using R for analysis and visualization of a range of data types relevant for bioassessment. 

### Objectives of the Course

By the end of this course you should be able to or have the resources to find out how to: 

 - 1. use R to import and organize California bioassessment data, 
 - 2. create plots using R packages to explore data trends, and 
 - 3. create maps in R to explore spatial patterns for reporting. 

The course website is in development, but will contain a syllabus and other instructions for preparing for the workshop.
