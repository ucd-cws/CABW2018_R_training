Source materials for CABW 2020 R training workshop, see the link in the header to view the website. 

R is a language for statistical computing as well as a general-purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences. This workshop will provide attendees with the
foundations for continued learning of R and for analysis of a range of data types relevant for bioassessment. By the end of this course you should be able to or have the resources to find out how to 1) use R to import and organize California bioassessment data, 2) create plots using R packages to explore data trends, and 3) create maps in R to explore spatial patterns and
generate reports. The course website contains a syllabus and other instructions for
preparing for the course (see 2018 for example: https://sccwrp.github.io/CABW2018_R_training/index.html)
